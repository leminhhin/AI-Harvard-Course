## Neural networks

### Activation function

### Mini batch gradient descent

### Multilayer neural network

#### 	Backpropagation

### Overfitting

#### 	Dropout

â€‹		random drop nodes from layer

---

## Computer vision

### Image convolution

apply filter matrix

extract features (edges)

### Pooling - max pooling

reduce dimension

1 pixel represents for a region

---

## Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

convolution -> pooling -> flattening -> neural networks

---

## Recurrent neural networks (RNN)

feed output of previous network to next network
